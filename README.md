Tutorium-3DsMax
===============

Repo for the tutorium

Due to some lucky circumstances, I have been able to give some kind of 3DsMax-course throughout a whole semester at the Fachhochschule WÃ¼rzburg.
Each week we spent some time learning basic knowledge and techniques about 3DsMax.

Keypoints were:

- Modelling
- Splines
- Modifier
- Materials
- Lights
- Texturing
- Animations

All lectures + some example files, animations are uploaded here.
Again thanks for your time!
